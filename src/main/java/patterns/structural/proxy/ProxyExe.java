/*
GoF Definition: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Concept
We want to use a class which can perform as an interface to something else.

Real–Life Example
In a classroom, when one student is absent, during roll call, his best friend may try to mimic the student’s
voice to try to keep his friend from being marked as absent.

Computer World Example
Consider an ATM implementation for a bank. Here we will find multiple proxy objects. Actual bank
information will be stored in a remote server. We must remember that in the real programming world, the
creation of multiple instances of a complex object (heavy object) is very costly. In such situations, we can
create multiple proxy objects (which must point to an original object) and the total creation of actual objects
can be carried out on a demand basis. Thus we can save both the memory and creational time.
